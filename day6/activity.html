        <h>What is a rainbow?</h><br>
        <p1>A rainbow is sunlight spread out into its spectrum of colour and diverted to the eye of the observer by water droplete. The bow part of the word refers to the fact that the rainbow is a group of nearly circular arcs of colour all having a common center.</p1><br>
        <h>What makes the bow?</h><br>
        <p2>The main ingredients to see a rainbow are the following:</p2>
        <p3>You need to be standing with the sun to your back and the rain in frount of you.</p3><br>
        <p4>The sun needs to be less than 42<sup>o</sup> above the horizon.</p4><br>
        <p5>The sun's rays must be hitting the raindrops to create the rainbow.</p5><br>
        <h>Why did people in Ireland belive there was gold at the end of rainbow?</h><br>
        <p6>Even as far back as the 17th cencturay people knew that we cannot see the complet cricle of the rainbow. The expression samehow changed and become a part of mythology. </p6>
